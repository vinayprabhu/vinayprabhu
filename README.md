### Hi there 👋

I use Github to learn, collaborate and share some *interesting* projects I have been working on.

My last few 🐐 projects include
- [Sigbovik-2021 paper](https://github.com/vinayprabhu/Revenge_of_the_pith_Sigbovik2021)
- [What do they mean when they say X-is-all-you-need](https://github.com/vinayprabhu/X-is-all-you-need)
- [Grassmannian packing tutorials](https://github.com/vinayprabhu/Grassmannian_tutorials)


Want to collaborate on something, preferrably at the intersection of useful-ish, fascinating and good kinda weird?
